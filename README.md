# Sample scripts for Solana Native SDK by Neon EVM
 
1. Copy the scripts and create a new repo with them to run and test how they work.
2. Observe:
- Gas estimation
- Balance changes
- tx hash resolution from Neon RPC
- 
You don’t need to write your own script to submit the task—but playing with the code is highly recommended!
